# EngraveNFT1155- Flexible Soulbound NFTs to help people connect

This project comes ready to groove via hardhat. A .env files is needed in order to connect with a testnet, or mainnet. The project is using Hardhat Runtime Environment (HRE) as the default.

The following hardhat scripts can be accessed via npm :
```shell
    "compile": "npx hardhat compile" - compiles the smart contracts
    "local-node": "npx hardhat node" - starts that hre
    "start-console": "npx hardhat console" - provide a console to interace with hardhat runtime env
    "test": "npx hardhat test && npx hardhat run coverage" - runs the test suites and provides a report
```

Vscode Debugger and Launch.json:

If one wants to debug a script, they can just open scripts file and use the 'hardhat script' configuration. It's set up to run 'npx hardhat run filename.ts' on the open file.

If one wants to debug a test, they same approach can be used for the 'hardhat test' configuration. It's  set up to run 'npx hardhat test filename.ts' on the open file. 


To do list:
Integrate with Ipfs?
intergrate with chainlink?
integrate with uri patterns?
